        <h1><em>INTRODUCTION</em></h1>
        <p>Our project is about a system which will extinguish the fire by <br> 
            taking the minimum time.The purpose of our project is to save <br>
            water by using fire extinguishing bomb in place of water and <br> 
            avoiding human injuries or suffocation of any living being causing <br> 
            death. To rescue the people without harming anything. Using IoT & 5G for <br>
            faster communication services.</p>

         <h2>Problem:-</h2>
         <P>Nowadays, there is water scarcity in the world and many buildings <br>
            are catching fire and normally, they are using water sprinklers for<br>
            extinguishing fire where a lot of water is wasted with the wastage<br>
            of time. But if the fire is caused due to petroleum or shot <br>
            circuit, we cannot use water sprinklers as a common extinguisher.<br>
            For that reason now a day’s people are using fire extinguishing <br>
            bomb for extinguishing fire but it is very harmful as it contains <br>
            compressed carbon dioxide gas and if a person inhales this gas he/she <br>
            may die. But there is no system made till now which can launch the<br>
            bomb automatically towards the fire at the minimum time; using the <br>
            maximum speed to transmit the data to the necessary addresses like <br>
            the fire station, neighboring area, family members; to prevent the<br>
            human beings from injury or suffocation.</P>
           

        <h2>Solution:-</h2>
        <img src="5G.png" alt=" 5G PICTUER IS TO BE HERE" style="float: left; height: 9cm; width: 10cm;" >
        <p>  In our system, there will be a safety mask and safety glass thrower. <br>
             When the fire sensor will sense the fire, the mask and glass thrower<br>
             will be activated and throw the masks and safety glass in all the <br>
             direction so that the people can wear it and be safe. But when there <br>
             will be nobody in the room and fire is caused by any source, the <br>
             masks, glasses will be wasted and time will be wasted so the system <br>
             will not throw the safety masks and glasses only if there is no person<br>
             sensor (this sensor will be attached near the door to count the <br>
             incoming person number and the outgoing person number to calculate the<br>
             number of people in the room). And, after the people who are present <br>
             in the room wear the masks and glasses, the bomb-thrower will throw <br>
             the bomb. To drop the bomb in the perfect place we are using fire tracker. <br>
             And, after that, the laser light exit signal will be given to the people <br>
             present in the room. After that our system will release oxygen gas to <br>
             maintain the amount of oxygen in the room and not to give any chance of <br>
             suffocation of any person in the room with the permission of the owner or <br>
             relative of the owner of the house or room through our app which will show <br>
             that is the fire is extinguished or still there because if the fire will be
             there then the oxygen will help to spread the fire, and this all will be
             shown by the small camera which will be there in the system. And with the 
             help of Node MCU, the message will be shown in the Google notes. So that 
             the people who will be using Google can come and help. And with the help 
             of Global System for Mobile (GSM) Module, the message (fire has been caught 
             in the particular location. Come for Help.) Will be sent to the Fire Station.
              
        </p>
        <h2>FIRE EXTINGUISHING BOMB Concept:-</h2>
        <p>Our carbon dioxide bomb will be made of glass which will store compressed  
            carbon dioxide gas and powder. The glass ball will be then coated with a 
            layer of plastics wilt a lot of holes in it so that the gas can come out 
            when the bomb falls down and glass breaks. We are coating it with plastic  
            so that the glass doesn't go into anyone's body.

        <h2>Special Features:-</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fire Extinguishing bomb is designed by us and we are not using the 
                concept which is used now-a-days in the fire extinguishing bomb.
                So, we are using a totally novel concept of Extinguishing the fire.</li>
            <li>Cost-effective</li>
            <li>Novel Idea(We have researched for similar Ideas and patents in 
                different websites by giving keywords and we have not got a single 
                idea or patent which is similar to our idea).</li>
            <li>Connected to Google/Think Speak with node MCU.</li>
            <li>Automatic control.</li>
            <li>Accurate tracking of fire.</li>
            <li>Maintains the amount of oxygen in the room after the explosion of Fire Extinguishing Bomb.</li>
            <li>Sends the message to fire brigade team.</li>
            <li>App controlled.</li>
            
        </ol>
        <h2>Advantages:-</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fire will be automatically extinguished in less time with Fire Extinguishing Bomb.</li>
            <li>The fire can be tracked so that the Fire Extinguishing Bomb will fall in the accurate place.</li>
            <li>The system will maintain the amount of oxygen in the room.</li>
